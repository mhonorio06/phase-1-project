collectible figurines bid war

Introduction

Attention all geeks and nerds alike. It seems like whoever you are that everyone loves a good hobby and starting a collection of sorts so I decided the best to involve myself in the same things is create and build and fortunately I love both. I love to create figurines and models and terreriums of all shapes and sizes or different genres. I decided to build a website that promotes the selling of wonderful artwork that I have brought to life including busts and life- size colectibles that people can bid on. I have a few family members that are always spending their hard earned money on collectible figures for beaucoup bucks!! I thought that I could make a project capitalizing on that very idea.

Setup

This project takes a list of collectibles from a json file and renders them onto the page. A form was created so that you could add the names of different characters and their information and bid on those different items and it all goes to the highest bidder.

Credits

I took a lot of information from google and asking friends and family for advice when I got stuck along the way.The biggest help was probably from google.
